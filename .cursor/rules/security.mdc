# Security Standards

## Security Tools
- **Use bandit** for security vulnerability scanning
- **Use ruff** with security rules enabled
- Run security checks as part of the development workflow

## Secrets Management
- **Ansible projects**: Use Ansible Vault for secrets, keep vault password in `secrets.txt` (add to .gitignore)
- **Other projects**: Use encrypted secrets files, password/key files excluded from version control
- **NEVER commit secrets or credentials** to version control

## Authentication
- **Use OAuth** for authentication strategy
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Follow security best practices for API authentication

## OWASP Top 10 Prevention
Prevent these vulnerabilities:
- SQL injection (use parameterized queries, ORMs)
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) - sanitize inputs, escape outputs
- Command injection (avoid shell=True, validate inputs)
- Path traversal (validate file paths)
- Insecure deserialization
- Broken authentication
- Sensitive data exposure
- XML External Entities (XXE)
- Broken access control
- Security misconfiguration

## CI/CD Security
Ensure CI pipeline includes:
- Linting with security rules (ruff)
- Security vulnerability scanning (bandit)
- Dependency vulnerability checks
