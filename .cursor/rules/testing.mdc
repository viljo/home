# Testing Standards - Test-Driven Development

## TDD Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: ALWAYS write unit tests FIRST
- **Ask before implementing**: Request information needed to write comprehensive tests
- Tests should be written first, then implementation to satisfy the tests

## Change Workflow
When receiving user input:
1. Update the specification (ask user if new input conflicts with existing spec)
2. Update the tests based on new requirements
3. Update the code to match updated tests and spec
4. Verify implementation against specification and tests

## Python Testing Setup
- **Use pytest** as the testing framework for all Python projects
- **Test directory structure**: Always create a `tests/` subfolder containing all test code
- **Pytest fixtures**: Create proper pytest fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` for reusable test components
- **Manual test script**: Create a shell script (e.g., `run_tests.sh`) for manual test runs
- **Coverage reporting**: Include pytest-cov for test coverage metrics

## IDE Test Configurations
- Create test run configurations for VS Code (`.vscode/settings.json`)
- Create test run configurations for PyCharm (`.idea/runConfigurations/`)
- Enable static code analysis as per CI pipeline (ruff, bandit)
- Ensure tests can be run both via IDE and command line

## GUI Application Testing
For GUI applications, ALWAYS include:
- Button click simulation and interaction
- Screenshot capture and verification
- Visual regression testing
- End-to-end user workflow validation
- Use pytest-qt, selenium, or playwright
