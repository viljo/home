# Python Development Standards

## Package Management
- **Always use `uv`** for Python package management and virtual environments
- Prefer `uv` commands over pip/virtualenv/poetry
- **Use `pyproject.toml`** for project configuration
- **Minimal dependencies as first choice**: Prefer standard library solutions when possible

## Project Structure
- **Use src/ layout** for Python projects with a separate `tests/` directory
- Always add `.gitignore` to every project from the start

## Code Quality
- **Prioritize readability** unless specific performance requirements are stated
- **Use ruff** for linting and code quality checks (including security rules)
- Code should be clear and maintainable first, optimized second
- **Use bandit** for security vulnerability scanning

## Logging & Configuration
- **Use loguru** for logging (not standard library logging)
- **Use pydantic-settings** for environment configuration and .env file handling

## IDE Setup
- Create run/debug configurations for both VS Code and PyCharm
- Enable static code analysis (ruff, bandit) in IDEs
- Configure to run checks automatically on save or before test runs
