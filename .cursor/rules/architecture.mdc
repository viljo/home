# Architecture Principles

## Layered Architecture (STRONGLY PREFERRED)
- **Organize code into distinct layers**: presentation, business logic, data access
- **Separation of concerns**: Each component/module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Loose coupling**: Components are independent and communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **High cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together

## Design Patterns
- **Dependency injection**: Use DI patterns for testability and flexibility
- **Interface-based design**: Program to interfaces, not implementations
- **SOLID principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **Modularity**: Design in small, reusable, independently testable modules

## Agile-Friendly Design
- **Clear boundaries**: Enable parallel development across layers/components
- **Incremental delivery**: Support iterative, incremental feature delivery
- **Refactoring-friendly**: Structure code to be easily refactored as requirements evolve

These principles simplify agile development by:
- Enabling parallel work on different layers/components
- Making it easier to change requirements without ripple effects
- Facilitating test-driven development through testable components
- Supporting continuous integration and deployment

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Prefer native Debian 13 components** when designing software architecture
- Even on macOS, design with Debian 13 native components for portability
- **Target platforms**: macOS (ARM/Apple Silicon), Linux (x86-64), Windows (x86-64)
- Choose libraries that support all three platforms
